Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size.
Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. 
Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered a and b into the same group.
Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

Example 1:
Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false
 
Note:
1 <= N <= 2000
0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000
1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N
dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]
There does not exist i != j for which dislikes[i] == dislikes[j].

class Solution:
    def possibleBipartition(self, N: int, dislikes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        def dfs(node , group):
            if groups[node] == -1:
                groups[node] = group
            else:
                return groups[node] == group
            for n in adjDict[node]:
                if not dfs(n , 1 - group):
                    return False
            return True
        adjDict , groups = defaultdict(list) , [-1 for i in range(N)]
        for u , v in dislikes:
            adjDict[u - 1].append(v - 1) # 0 indexing
            adjDict[v - 1].append(u - 1) # 0 indexing
        for i in range(N):
            if groups[i] == -1 and not dfs(i , 0):
                return False
        return True
